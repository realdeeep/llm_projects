# LLM Projects Repository

This repository contains three LLM-based projects built using OpenAI's GPT models, LangChain, and Streamlit. These projects demonstrate different applications of LLMs, including PDF querying, chatbot development, and sequential chains for recommendations.

## Projects

### 1. PDF Query Tool
- Extracts text from PDFs and stores them efficiently using Astra DB.
- Uses LangChain to create a vector database for querying document content.
- Allows users to ask questions about the document and receive relevant answers.

ðŸ“‚ **Folder:** `pdf_query_tool`

### 2. LLM Chatbot
- A simple chatbot built using LangChain and Streamlit.
- Takes user input and generates responses using OpenAI's GPT model.
- Interactive web-based interface.

ðŸ“‚ **Folder:** `llm_chatbot`

### 3. Sequential Chain Recommendation System
- Uses LangChain's `SequentialChain` to generate book recommendations.
- Given a career choice, suggests a relevant book and summarizes it.
- Includes a Streamlit interface for user interaction.

ðŸ“‚ **Folder:** `sequential_chain_recommendation`
